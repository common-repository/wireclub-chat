== Description ==

I hope you enjoy our embedded chat plug-in. It is completely free and we just ask that you do not remove our links
because this is how we are able keep it as a free service. If you remove our links, you can expect to be punished by karma.
What goes around...comes around!

Important note about room names: Rooms are globaly shared across all users of this plug-in.

Example: if you and a friend want to have a shared room, just install the plug-in and pick the same room name. 
If you want to make sure your room isn't shared, just pick a unique name!
